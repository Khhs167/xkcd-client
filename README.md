This is just a stupid little project i decided to make for fun. The code is basic, poorly written, but does work both online and offline!  

To use it, just do `dotnet run` or build it and run the executable. 

If online it'll download the latest comic, if offline, it'll display the latest downloaded comic. If offline and no comics are stored, it will shut down.  

Once inside the program, just click to load another random comic, either online or offline.
